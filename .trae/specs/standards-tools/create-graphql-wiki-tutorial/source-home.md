- Typesafe schemas, secure requests
- Frictionless distributed development
- Data driven UI at scale

## GraphQL is open source and trusted by the industry

Facebook's mobile apps have been powered by GraphQL since 2012. The GraphQL specification was open-sourced in 2015. Now it is used by industry-leading companies worldwide and supported by the GraphQL Foundation, hosted since 2018 by the non-profit Linux Foundation.

Introduction

## What is GraphQL?

GraphQL is an open‑source query language for APIs and a server‑side runtime. It provides a strongly‑typed schema to define relationships between data, making APIs more flexible and predictable. And it isn’t tied to a specific database or storage engine — it works with your existing code and data, making it easier to evolve APIs over time.

```
query getCity($city: String) {
  cities(name: $city) {
    population
    weather {
      temperature
      precipitation
    }
  }
}
```

How it works

## A GraphQL Query

1. ```
	type Project {
	  name: String!
	  tagline: String
	  contributors(first: Int, after: ID): [User!]!
	}
	```
2. ```
	{
	  project(name: "GraphQL") {
	    tagline
	  }
	}
	```
3. ```
	{
	  "project": {
	    "tagline": "A query language for APIs"
	  }
	}
	```

design principles

## Five Pillars of GraphQL

### Product-centric

GraphQL is unapologetically built for front-end engineers, aligning with their way of thinking, how views are structured and how data is consumed.

### Hierarchical

Most product development involves the creation and manipulation of view hierarchies. GraphQL queries mirror UI structures, ensuring a natural way to request data that matches the shape of the response.

### Strong-typing

Every GraphQL service defines a type system, enabling tools to syntactically validate queries before execution and ensuring predictable responses.

### Client-specified response

A GraphQL service publishes the capabilities that its clients are allowed to consume. It is the client who control the data they receive, requesting only what they need at a field level, unlike traditional fixed endpoints.

### Self-documenting

GraphQL APIs can describe themselves, allowing tools and clients to query the schema for available types and capabilities. It serves as a powerful platform for building common tools and client software libraries.

## Powered by the community

GraphQL is an ecosystem shaped by thousands of collaborating developers and companies around the world. From solo contributors to full-time maintainers, the GraphQL community builds libraries, runs meetups, funds innovation and helps move the technology forward.

GraphQL advantages

### Precision

**Ask for what you need, get exactly that**

Send a GraphQL query to your API and get precisely the data you request — no over-fetching, no under-fetching. Predictable responses keep apps efficient and performant.

[Learn GraphQL](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### Optimization

**Retrieve multiple resources in one request**

GraphQL seamlessly follows relationships between data, eliminating multiple API calls. While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request. Ideal for complex queries and optimizing network performance.

[Read the docs](https://graphql.org/learn/)

### Productivity

**Move faster with powerful, community-built tools**

Know exactly what you can request without leaving editor. Highlight potential issues before sending a query and take advantage of improved code intelligence. GraphQL makes it easy to build powerful tools. And many of them, like GraphiQL, are open source and built by the GraphQL community.

[Explore GraphQL tools](https://graphql.org/community/tools-and-libraries/)

### Consistency

**Build confidently with a type-safe schema**

GraphQL APIs are structured around types and fields, not endpoints. This ensures data consistency, self-documentation, and clear, actionable errors. Apps can use types to avoid writing manual parsing code.

[Learn more about GraphQL schemas](https://graphql.org/learn/schema/)

### Versionless

**Evolve without versions**

Add new fields and types without impacting existing queries. Deprecate outdated fields while keeping APIs clean and future-proof. By using a single evolving version, GraphQL APIs give apps continuous access to new features and encourage more maintainable server code.

[See more in docs](https://graphql.org/learn/schema-design/#versioning)

### Integration

**Bring your own data and code**

GraphQL is storage-agnostic — integrate databases, REST APIs, and third-party services into a single, cohesive data layer. Write GraphQL APIs that leverage your existing data and code with GraphQL engines available in many languages.
