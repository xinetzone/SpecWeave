## 1. Interpret Intent Before Writing

Your primary goal is to understand the *spirit* of the user's request, not just the literal words.

### 1.1 Intake Analysis

On receiving a writing task, actively analyze the prompt:

1. **Purpose** — What is the underlying goal? (inform, persuade, educate, entertain, sell, document)
2. **Audience** — Who will read this? (executives, engineers, general public, domain experts, students)
3. **Tone & Mood** — What emotional register fits? (formal, conversational, authoritative, playful, sober)
4. **Scope** — Is this a quick draft, a polished deliverable, or an iterative collaboration?
5. **Constraints** — Word count, language, format (Markdown, PDF, DOCX, Lark doc), branding requirements.

### 1.2 Persona Adoption

Based on the analysis above, creatively adopt the most appropriate writing persona. Do not default to a neutral, safe style. Strive for a result that reflects the user's true intent, even if not explicitly stated.

- Be bold — if context calls for a witty critic, patient teacher, enthusiastic evangelist, or sober analyst, embody that persona.
- When the user's preference is unclear, default to **rich, comprehensive, and well-structured content** — unless the user explicitly requests brevity.

### 1.3 Clarification Threshold

Ask clarifying questions **only** when ambiguity would lead to a fundamentally different deliverable. For minor uncertainties, make a reasonable assumption, state it, and proceed.

---

## 2. Genre & Format Selection

Before writing, determine the most appropriate genre and reference style.

### 2.1 Genre Identification

| Genre                         | Typical Triggers                                | Key Characteristics                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Academic / Research Paper** | "paper", "study", "literature review"           | Formal, evidence-based, structured sections, citations |
| **Technical Documentation**   | "docs", "API guide", "README", "specification"  | Precise, task-oriented, code examples, clear hierarchy |
| **Blog Post / Article**       | "blog", "article", "post", "write about"        | Engaging lead, conversational, opinion-allowed         |
| **News / Journalism**         | "news", "report on event", "coverage"           | Inverted pyramid, attribution, neutral tone            |
| **Opinion / Essay**           | "essay", "opinion", "argue", "perspective"      | Thesis-driven, persuasive, personal voice              |
| **Tutorial / How-to**         | "tutorial", "guide", "how to", "step by step"   | Progressive disclosure, practical, hands-on            |
| **Marketing / Copy**          | "landing page", "copy", "campaign", "pitch"     | Benefit-focused, concise, call-to-action               |
| **Creative / Narrative**      | "story", "narrative", "creative writing"        | Show-don't-tell, vivid prose, character/scene-driven   |
| **Internal Memo / Brief**     | "memo", "brief", "internal", "summary for team" | Direct, action-oriented, audience-aware                |
| **Product Requirements**      | "PRD", "requirements", "spec", "user stories"   | Structured, unambiguous, acceptance criteria           |

### 2.2 Reference Style Calibration

Identify classic works, renowned publications, or established writing styles relevant to the target genre. Use these as **inspiration** — blend, modify, or transcend them as needed.

Examples:

- Travel guide → adopt **Lonely Planet**'s narrative warmth and practical specificity.
- Technical deep-dive → channel **Stripe's engineering blog** clarity and progressive depth.
- Business analysis → reference **Harvard Business Review**'s analytical rigor with accessible language.
- Product launch → emulate **Apple Newsroom**'s concise, benefit-led storytelling.

### 2.3 Multi-Format Awareness & Default Artifact Routing

**Default artifact rule for report-type tasks** (research reports, whitepapers, PRDs, proposals, competitive analyses, feasibility studies, technical documents, and any structured written deliverable):

> **Default → `html-report` skill.** Unless the user **explicitly** states that the final deliverable must be a `.docx` or `.pdf` file, route the artifact production to the `html-report` skill (which produces a self-contained HTML report). Keywords that trigger format-specific routing:
> - `.docx` / Word / DOCX → route to `docx` skill
> - `.pdf` / PDF → route to `pdf` skill
>
> Vague requests like "write a report", "draft a PRD", "do a research report" **without** mentioning a specific file format → always use the `html-report` skill as the artifact format.

When the output format **is** explicitly specified (PDF, DOCX, Lark doc, Markdown, webpage), adapt formatting conventions accordingly and delegate format-specific rendering to the appropriate sub-Skill or tool Skill (e.g., `pdf`, `docx`, `pptx`).

## 3. Language to Avoid

### 3.1 Anti-Patterns in Task Descriptions

When delegating to agents or planning content, **never** use checklist-style, corporate-jargon, or workaholic language in task descriptions:

❌ **Prohibited phrasing:**

- "可操作", "可执行", "检查清单", "可参考", "定期复盘", "x 天行动计划"
- "actionable checklist", "30-day action plan", "weekly review cadence"
- Framing human experiences as optimizable workflows

❌ **Do NOT write task descriptions like this:**

> 面向职场与高校的普通读者，围绕"吸引力—社交拓展—沟通—约会—推进关系—复盘"的完整路径设计。
> 每章给出可落地动作与话术示例，避免空泛理论。读完即可开干。
> 建议配合"30 天行动计划"和"每周复盘"，在 4–8 周内感受到明显变化。

✅ **Instead, phrase naturally:**

> 在探讨如何"脱单"之前，我们首先需要明白，这并非一场狩猎游戏，而是一场向内探索、而后向外连接的旅程。市面上充斥着太多关于"技巧"和"套路"的讨论，仿佛爱情是一场可以通过公式计算和策略部署来赢得的战役。然而，这种观念恰恰是通往真挚关系的最大障碍。

### 3.2 Anti-Patterns in Content Body

| Avoid                                              | Prefer                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Imperative checklists disguised as prose           | Descriptive, explanatory language                        |
| Translationese (stiff literal translations)        | Idiomatic, natural phrasing in the target language       |
| Excessive jargon without context                   | Technical terms introduced with brief inline explanation |
| Over-compressed bullet storms                      | Flowing paragraphs where logical flow matters            |
| Empty superlatives ("world-class", "cutting-edge") | Specific, evidence-backed claims                         |
| Formulaic section stubs ("参考资料", "致谢", "附件列表")     | Include only if explicitly requested or genuinely needed |
| Rhetorical or persuasive section headings          | Descriptive, neutral headings stating what the section covers |
| Stiff, bureaucratic, or overly abstract wording ("进行赋能", "实现闭环", "显式标注") | Plain, conversational phrasing a non-specialist can parse on first read |
| Coinage overload — stacking self-invented abstract nouns ("飞轮", "入口层", "会话层", "协作语义") | Max ONE coined abstraction per paragraph; replace the rest with concrete descriptions of what actually happens |
| Saying the same conclusion 3 times in different words across sections (intro summary ≈ core judgment ≈ conclusion) | State a conclusion ONCE in its canonical location; other sections may reference it but must add new evidence or angle, never just rephrase |

### 3.3 Sections to Avoid Unless Requested

Do NOT create these sections by default — only include them when the user explicitly asks:

- "图表与附件" / "附件列表"
- "参考资料" / "References" / "Bibliography"
- "致谢" / "Acknowledgments"
- "数据源" / "Data Sources"
- "XX清单" / "XX Checklist"

### 3.4 Paragraph-Level Anti-Patterns

| Rule | Description | Violation Example |
| ---- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| **No heading-echo** | A section's first sentence must NOT restate or explain what the heading already says. Open with a fact, data point, or decision. | ❌ "本章介绍用户增长策略。" / "This section covers the authentication flow." |
| **No meta-narration** | Never use self-referential narration that describes what the text is about to do. Jump straight into substance. | ❌ "下面我们来看…" / "接下来将详细分析…" / "Let us now examine…" |
| **No "manifesto" openers** | Do not open a paragraph or article with "这不是一篇…而是…" / "真正的问题不是…而是…" / "本文试图…". Readers judge the text by its content, not by the author's self-positioning. | ❌ "这不是一篇并购新闻解读，而是一篇从浏览器热议反推公司成长逻辑的复盘。" |
| **No insight-escalation frames** | Eliminate rhetorical "not X but Y" structures whose sole purpose is to sound profound. State the real judgment directly without the contrast crutch. Common offenders: "真正的X不是……而是……", "这不仅仅是……更是……", "最后比拼的是……", "不应只是X，而应Y", "本质上不是X，而是Y". | ❌ "这次活动不应只是送券，而应围绕核心价值设计成…" → ✅ "活动以一次有效使用触发即时奖励，把奖品和产品价值感绑定。" |
| **One-statement rule** | A conclusion may appear in full exactly ONCE in its canonical section. Other sections that reference it must contribute new evidence or a new angle — never merely rephrase. | ❌ Intro says "A是核心壁垒", body says "A构成关键护城河", conclusion says "A最终成为不可替代的优势" |

### 3.5 Sentence-Level Anti-Patterns

| Rule | Description | Fix |
| ---- | ----------- | --- |
| **No dummy-verb structures** | Eliminate "进行"/"开展"/"实施" + noun patterns. Use the verb directly. | "进行分析" → "分析"；"开展调研" → "调研"；"实施优化" → "优化" |
| **No unverifiable "确保"** | When "确保" is followed by an unverifiable goal, replace with a measurable criterion. | ❌ "确保用户体验良好" → ✅ "页面加载 ≤ 2s，操作反馈 ≤ 200ms" |
| **No empty intensifiers** | Delete "非常"/"极其"/"highly"/"extremely"/"significantly" when not followed by quantitative evidence. | ❌ "显著提升了效率" → ✅ "处理时间从 4.2s 降至 1.1s" |

### 3.6 Formatting Discipline

| Rule | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Bold scope** | Bold is reserved for: proper nouns, tool/command names, and critical warnings. Do NOT use bold for rhetorical emphasis in running prose — rely on sentence structure to convey importance. Limit: ≤ 3 bold spans per section. |
| **No bold+italic stacking** | `***text***` is forbidden. |
| **No emoji unless requested** | Documents must not contain emoji or decorative Unicode symbols unless the user explicitly asks. (✅❌⚠️ are permitted only in checklist/diagnostic contexts within the skill itself, not in user-facing deliverables.) |
| **No punctuation in headings** | Markdown headings must not end with periods, colons, or question marks (exception: genuine question headings). |

## 4. Content Structure

### 4.1 Structure Selection

Based on the genre and purpose, determine the most appropriate delivery approach:

| Approach       | Best For                                                          | Characteristics                                                                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured** | Technical docs, reports, tutorials, PRDs                          | Clear sections, headings, numbered steps, organized frameworks                    |
| **Narrative**  | Feature articles, travel guides, opinion pieces, creative content | Storytelling flow, scene-setting, character/example-driven                        |
| **Free-form**  | Personal essays, creative writing, exploratory thought pieces     | Organic idea development, flexible organization                                   |
| **Hybrid**     | Complex deliverables, long-form analysis                          | Strategic blend — e.g., narrative intro → structured body → reflective conclusion |

### 4.2 Key Principles

- **Substance over format** — structure serves content, never constrains it.
- **Never pre-impose components** — do NOT instruct agents to follow a rigid outline (e.g., "must contain Introduction, Background, Summary, Conclusion") before content development. The optimal structure emerges as insights develop.
- **Soft guidance over hard templates** — provide inspirational references (e.g., "refer to *Stripe's engineering blog* for structure inspiration") rather than prescriptive section lists.
- **Adapt to complexity** — a simple answer needs no headings; a 5,000-word analysis needs clear hierarchy.

### 4.3 Formatting Guidelines

| Element             | Guideline                                                                                                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headings**        | Brief, concise, functional — convey the section's purpose at a glance                                                  |
| **Emphasis**        | Strategic use of **bold** for key concepts, principles, data points. Avoid over-bolding                                |
| **Visual elements** | Callouts, tables, inline code, diagrams — embedded naturally within text flow                                          |
| **Paragraphs**      | 3–8 sentences for most content; shorter for high-impact points                                                         |
| **Lists**           | Use when information is naturally list-like (options, features, steps, pros/cons). For extended analysis, prefer prose |
| **Transitions**     | Make logical flow explicit — "Building on this…", "In contrast…", "This raises the question of…"                       |

### 4.4 Richtext Formatting (Lark/Feishu Documents)

When writing `lark.md` documents, reference the `Lark/Feishu Markdown Writing Styles Guide` in the knowledge base and make full use of rich lark.md syntax features — callouts, grids, code blocks, tables, and embedded visual elements.

---

## 5. Visual Generation Guide

### 5.1 When to Generate Visuals

- User explicitly requests charts, diagrams, or illustrations, **OR**
- Content involves ≥3 comparable data points (numbers, percentages, metrics) where a chart conveys the relationship faster than prose, **OR**
- A trend, ranking, or proportion is being described in text that would take fewer words with a visual, **OR**
- A process, architecture, or relationship would be clearer as a diagram than as prose.

**Bias toward visualization**: When in doubt whether data warrants a chart, prefer generating one. A simple bar or line chart that reinforces the text is better than a paragraph of numbers that readers must mentally parse.

### 5.2 Constraints

- Chart data must be sourced and accurate — no interpolation of missing intervals, no fabricated numbers.
- Place visuals immediately after the relevant analysis paragraph, not grouped in an appendix.
- Caption every visual with a clear, descriptive label.

### 5.3 Type Selection

| Purpose                        | Default Type                                       |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Trend over time                | Line chart                                         |
| Magnitude comparison           | Bar chart                                          |
| Proportion breakdown           | Pie (≤6 slices) / Stacked bar                      |
| Multi-dimensional relationship | Scatter / Radar                                    |
| Process / Decision flow        | Flowchart (Graphviz or PlantUML)                   |
| System architecture            | Architecture diagram (Graphviz)                    |
| Sequential interaction         | Sequence diagram (PlantUML)                        |
| Timeline / Schedule            | Gantt chart (PlantUML)                             |
| Structured comparison          | Table (preferred over chart when data is discrete) |

### 5.4 Integration Principles

- **Seamless embedding** — weave visuals into text flow rather than clustering them in a separate section.
- **Visual–text correspondence** — every chart or diagram must be referenced and explained in the surrounding prose.
- **Accessibility** — provide alt-text or descriptive captions so content is understandable without the visual.

---

## 6. Sub-Scenario Routing

Route to the matched reference based on the writing task's genre, purpose, and deliverable type. Each reference inherits all constraints from this parent and adds domain-specific templates, structures, quality gates, and workflow steps.

> **Invocation method**: When routing to a sub-scenario, **Read** the corresponding reference file from `references/` in this skill's directory (e.g., `references/prd-document.md`) and follow the instructions within. Do NOT attempt to recall the reference content from memory — always load the file to ensure the full, up-to-date instructions are applied.

### 6.1 Routing Table

| Reference | File | Route When |
|-----------|------|------------|
| `interact-prd-document` | `references/interact-prd-document.md` | User asks for the prototype-centered interactive PRD paradigm: a persistent clickable prototype as the primary review surface, paired with linked requirement text. Evaluate explicit signals for this row first. This reference owns content logic; for HTML structure, visual system, and interaction templates, invoke the `html-report` skill rather than reading its internal reference files directly. |
| `prd-document` | `references/prd-document.md` | User asks for a conventional chapter-based PRD. HTML output may and usually should contain interactive prototype demos embedded inside functional requirement sections. |

### 6.2 Routing Decision Rules

Apply these rules in order. Stop at the first matching rule.

1. **Explicit paradigm signal → prototype-centered interactive PRD.** Route to `interact-prd-document.md` when the prompt says any equivalent of:
   - 可交互 PRD、交互式 PRD、interactive PRD、原型式 PRD、prototype-first PRD
   - 以原型为核心、原型优先、原型是主体、先体验再看需求
   - 左侧原型右侧文档、左右结构、分屏 PRD、原型常驻
   - 原型和需求联动、点击原型定位需求、双向联动、预览/文本模式切换
2. **Explicit artifact description → prototype-centered interactive PRD.** Route to `interact-prd-document.md` when the user asks for one self-contained HTML artifact whose main experience is clicking through a complete product prototype while reading linked requirements beside it. The literal phrase “可交互 PRD” is sufficient; do not downgrade it to the conventional PRD route.
3. **Prototype-centered review intent → interactive PRD.** Route to `interact-prd-document.md` when the user emphasizes reviewing screens, flows, and states through one prominent persistent prototype, even if they do not name the left/right layout.
4. **Embedded-demo intent → conventional PRD.** Route to `prd-document.md` when the user wants a normal PRD structure with background, goals, and functional requirement chapters, with interactive demos embedded inside the relevant chapters or modules.
5. **Generic PRD → conventional PRD.** If the prompt only says PRD/需求文档/产品需求/功能说明, route to `prd-document.md`. Its default HTML output can still contain interactive prototypes; “interactive” is not exclusive to the prototype-centered reference.
6. **Format constraints.** Explicit text-only Markdown, DOCX, or PDF routes to `prd-document.md` unless the user also requests a separate interactive HTML companion.
7. **Tie-break by document architecture.** Ask which architecture the user wants only when both are equally plausible and the choice would materially change the deliverable. Otherwise, use explicit wording; if none exists, default to the conventional chapter-based PRD.
8. **Fall through to this skill.** If no reference matches, handle the task directly using §1–§5.
9. **Compound tasks.** Route each distinct deliverable independently.

### 6.3 Routing Examples

| User Request | Route | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| “写一个会员积分 PRD” | `prd-document` | Generic PRD with no prototype signal |
| “写一个会员积分 PRD，每个功能章节配可点击 Demo” | `prd-document` | Conventional chapters with embedded demos |
| “做一个会员积分可交互 PRD，以完整原型为主体，右侧联动需求” | `interact-prd-document` | Explicit prototype-centered paradigm |
| “给客服工作台做左右分屏 PRD，点击页面定位对应规则” | `interact-prd-document` | Persistent prototype and linked document |
| “输出客服工作台 PRD，纯文字 Markdown，不要原型” | `prd-document` | Explicit static override |
| “用 HTML 写完整 PRD，在需求详情中嵌入高保真原型” | `prd-document` | Embedded prototype inside conventional PRD |
