# Wiring Strategy

Inter-page `interactions` express clickable cross-page controls in preview. Canvas **visible wiring** is the subset of interactions that should be drawn as page-level business flow arrows. The planning dimension of visible wiring is **business flow between pages**; auxiliary navigation such as Back, return-to-list, global navigation, breadcrumbs, and skip links should usually remain clickable but hidden from the canvas with `hideEdge: true`. This document is the **sole authoritative definition** of wiring; all wiring behavior in workflows and file-specs must comply with this document.

## When to Wire

| Scenario | Wire? | Notes |
|------|---------|------|
| Creating a new canvas project | [Yes] Auto-wire | Main Agent plans the visible wiring map plus hidden interaction plan and passes relevant entries to Sub-Agents |
| User explicitly requests wiring | [Yes] Wire as requested | e.g., "add the new page to the navbar", "set up page navigation" |
| Adding a new page (navigation not mentioned) | [No] Do not wire | `interactions` remains empty array `[]` |
| Exploring new style / modifying theme | [No] Do not create new wiring | Existing `interactions` remain unchanged; no new wiring is added. Theme customization only updates CSS variables and `<head>` — it does not touch page structure or navigation |
| Generating page variants | [No] Do not wire | Variants are temporary comparison options and do not represent final navigation structure |
| Fork copy UI redesign | [No] Do not wire | Original interactions preserved in copy, but no new ones added |

## Wiring Map

When creating a new project, the Main Agent first plans both:

1. **Visible wiring map**: the core business flow arrows that should be drawn on the canvas.
2. **Hidden interaction plan**: clickable cross-page controls that should work in Preview but should not draw canvas edges.

### Map Format

```
Wiring Map:
  Homepage → Products (cta-products)
  Products → Pricing (cta-pricing)
  Pricing → Contact Us (cta-contact)

Hidden Interaction Plan:
  Products → Homepage (back-home, hideEdge=true, reason=back)
  Homepage → Blog (cta-blog, hideEdge=true, reason=secondary shortcut)
  Page 1 → Page 3 (link-details, hideEdge=true, reason=skip link / non-primary branch)
```

### Map Principles

**Design goal**: Wiring on the canvas should present as a clear unidirectional arrow chain, letting viewers immediately understand the browsing path between pages.

| Principle | Description |
|------|------|
| **Default linear single chain** | Pages connect end-to-end in logical order, each page 1 exit, last page 0 exits. This is the default topology when first creating a project, unless the business flow itself has branches |
| **Visible wiring = business flow, hidden interactions = auxiliary navigation** | Visible wiring only expresses the user's core browsing path (business funnel). Auxiliary navigation still needs `interactions` when the control is visibly clickable, but it should normally use `hideEdge: true` |
| **Visible wiring is unidirectional and acyclic** | Visible canvas edges must remain DAG. A→B must not produce a visible B→A edge. Return controls are allowed only as hidden interactions with `hideEdge: true`, not as ordinary reverse wiring |
| [Hard limit] **Per-page exits ≤ 2** | Default is 1 (linear single chain). Only allowed to be 2 when the business flow genuinely branches. Exceeding 2 indicates navigation component links are mixed in |
| [Hard limit] **Total visible wiring count ≤ page count** | Linear single chain = page count - 1. Hidden interactions with `hideEdge: true` are not counted as visible wiring |

**Self-check**: After planning the map, verify visible edges only — no cycles, per-page visible exits ≤ 2, visible count ≤ page count. Then verify every visibly clickable cross-page control is either in the visible wiring map or in the hidden interaction plan with `hideEdge: true`. This includes Back buttons, return-to-list controls, breadcrumbs, global nav items, secondary CTAs, skip links such as Page 1 → Page 3, overlay backdrops/scrims, and floating-layer close/cancel/back controls.

### State Group Wiring Self-check

For tab/modal/drawer/search/loading/empty/error/success states represented as separate canvas pages, the Main Agent must build this compact self-check from the existing wiring plan before final validation. This does not require an additional script; it feeds the existing `--require-interactions` argument when planned interactions exist.

```json
{
  "stateGroupWiringSelfCheck": {
    "allStateControlsHaveDomId": true,
    "allStateTargetsMatchExpectedPages": true,
    "allSameScreenStateLinksUseHideEdge": true,
    "requireInteractionsArgs": ["tab-info:order-info.html", "tab-chart:order-info.html"]
  }
}
```

If any field is false, fix the owning HTML or `.design` interactions before final validation. Do not add placeholder domIds only to satisfy the check.

---

## `data-dom-id` Naming Convention

When generating HTML, Sub-Agents add `data-dom-id` attributes to every visibly clickable control that should navigate to another page in the same project. The Main Agent decides whether each one is visible wiring or hidden interaction.

### Naming Format

| Element Position | Naming Format | Example |
|---------|---------|------|
| Navbar link | `nav-{target-page-name}` | `data-dom-id="nav-about"` |
| CTA button | `cta-{target-page-name}` | `data-dom-id="cta-pricing"` |
| Card/other link | `link-{target-page-name}` | `data-dom-id="link-portfolio"` |
| Secondary shortcut / skip link | `shortcut-{target-page-name}` or `link-{target-page-name}` | `data-dom-id="shortcut-blog"` |
| Back / return control | `back-{target-page-name}` or `back-previous` | `data-dom-id="back-products"` |

### Rules

- `{target-page-name}` uses kebab-case, consistent with the target page filename (minus `.html`)
- Only added for links pointing to **other pages within the project**; external links do not need it
- `href` attribute is uniformly set to `#` (the canvas SDK handles navigation through interactions)
- Each `data-dom-id` value must be unique within the same page; if both the navbar and page body have links to the same page, use different prefixes to distinguish (e.g., `nav-about` and `cta-about`)
- Do not use `data-dom-id` as the active-state key. Shared navigation/tab
  chrome uses `data-nav-key` / `data-tab-key` for active styling and
  `data-dom-id` only for clickable interaction registration. This lets every
  page set its active item through the `activeNavItem` / `activeTab` slot without
  changing the shared header/sidebar/tab DOM.
- Any visible cross-page control inside the project must either:
  - be listed in the visible wiring map and registered without `hideEdge`, or
  - be listed in the hidden interaction plan and registered with `hideEdge: true`.
- Global navigation components (navbar, Tab Bar, sidebar menu), breadcrumbs, secondary CTAs, and Page 1 → Page 3 skip links are usually hidden interactions: they should be clickable in preview but should not draw canvas edges.
- Back / return controls are allowed and expected on secondary/detail pages when the UI pattern calls for them. They must use `hideEdge: true`.
- Tab controls that switch between canvas state pages in the same `stateGroupId`
  are hidden interactions by default. They should be clickable in Preview but
  must not draw canvas edges because tab switching is UI state, not the primary
  business flow. The Main Agent must verify that every tab `data-dom-id` target
  matches the planned state page id and that every tab interaction uses
  `hideEdge: true`.
- Modal, drawer, popover, menu, command palette, preview panel, and other
  floating-layer states must include hidden return interactions for the
  backdrop/scrim when it is visually clickable, plus every explicit
  close/cancel/back control. These targets should point to the source/base page
  and must use `hideEdge: true`.

## Registering Wiring in the `.design` File

> **Wiring registration is the Main Agent's responsibility, not the Sub-Agent's.** When Sub-Agents execute in parallel, each can only see the page it is responsible for and cannot know other Sub-Agents' generated page node IDs. Therefore, having Sub-Agents register wiring would cause `targetPageId` to be missing or incorrect.

### Responsibility Division

| Role | Wiring-Related Responsibility |
|------|------------|
| **Sub-Agent** | Adds `data-dom-id` attributes in HTML for visible wiring entries and hidden interaction entries passed by Main Agent; does not register page nodes and does not write `.design` |
| **Main Agent** | After all Sub-Agents complete, reads the `.design` file and uniformly populates `interactions` arrays for each page node based on the visible wiring map and hidden interaction plan |

### Main Agent Registration Flow

After all Sub-Agents complete page generation (executed together with Step 3.5 page order rearrangement):

1. Read the `.design` file, obtain all page nodes' `id` and `title`
2. Based on the visible wiring map and hidden interaction plan, populate the `interactions` array for each source page node
3. Write back to the `.design` file
4. **Immediately re-read the `.design` file, verify item by item that every domId in the expected wiring list exists within the corresponding page node's `interactions`, and that targetPageId points to a valid node** — if any single item does not match, wiring must not be declared complete; must rewrite and re-verify.

When `runtime-orchestration-summary.json` exists, persist the result as:

```json
{
  "wiringRegistrationEvidence": {
    "expectedDomIds": ["cta-products:index.html"],
    "allExpectedDomIdsRegistered": true,
    "missingDomIds": []
  }
}
```

If `missingDomIds` is non-empty after one rewrite and one re-read, stop before full validation and report the missing entries. Do not use full project validation as the first way to discover expected interaction registration gaps.

```json
{
  "interactions": [
    { "domId": "nav-about", "targetPageId": "page-about-us", "transitionLabel": "Learn more" },
    { "domId": "cta-pricing", "targetPageId": "page-pricing", "transitionLabel": "See pricing" },
    { "domId": "shortcut-blog", "targetPageId": "page-blog", "hideEdge": true, "transitionLabel": "Read blog" },
    { "domId": "back-home", "targetPageId": "page-home", "hideEdge": true, "transitionLabel": "返回" }
  ]
}
```

- Each `domId` corresponds to a `data-dom-id` attribute value in the HTML
- `targetPageId` points to the target page node ID within the same group
- `hideEdge: true` means the interaction remains clickable in preview but does not draw a canvas edge. Use it for Back / return / close-to-list controls, global navigation links, breadcrumbs, secondary CTAs, skip links, overlay backdrops/scrims, floating-layer close/cancel/back controls, or any non-primary cross-page navigation that would clutter the canvas.
- [FORBIDDEN] Do not model return ability with a normal reverse interaction. If the target is a previous page, parent list, or source page, `hideEdge` must be `true`.
- `transitionLabel` is optional; describes the transition logic (e.g., "login success"). All interactions from the same source to the same target share the same label
- When both the visible wiring map and hidden interaction plan are empty, `interactions` remains empty array `[]`

---

## Version Convergence

When a comparison page **replaces** an existing page (the new page node carries `devMetadata.supersedesPageId`), the project must not leave a mixed-version navigation graph where the new-version flow can reach the retired old version in preview. This section is **mandatory** and overrides the "do not wire when adding pages" default in "When to Wire".

**Trigger**: Any page node written with `supersedesPageId` (e.g., Quick Path A0/A1 comparison pages that replace their source page, or Adopt Variant/Draft replacements). The Main Agent must perform convergence in the same round that writes the new node's wiring back to `.design`.

**Convergence procedure** (Main Agent, single pass):

1. **Redirect incoming edges**: Scan all page nodes' `interactions`; every entry whose `targetPageId` equals a superseded page id must be rewritten to point to the superseding page id. Keep `hideEdge` and `transitionLabel` unchanged.
2. **Retire outgoing edges**: Set the superseded page node's own `interactions` to empty array `[]`. The retired page stays on the canvas as a static comparison artifact; it must not navigate anywhere in preview.
3. **Chain convergence**: If the superseded page itself supersedes an earlier version (v3 → v2 → v1), walk the `supersedesPageId` chain and apply steps 1–2 to every superseded ancestor. All redirects target the **newest** version at the end of the chain.

**Self-check (blocking)**: After writing back, re-read `.design` and verify: (a) no page node's `interactions` contains a `targetPageId` referencing any superseded page; (b) every superseded page node's `interactions` is `[]`. Equivalently, a BFS from every non-superseded entry page must not reach any superseded page. If either check fails, fix and re-verify before declaring completion. The validation script (`validate-design-file-format.mjs` check 18) enforces the same invariants as a blocking error.

**Topology notes**: Convergence never adds visible edges — redirects inherit the original entry's `hideEdge` value, so the "visible count ≤ page count / per-page exits ≤ 2" hard limits are unaffected.

**When NOT to set `supersedesPageId`**: If the user explicitly asks to keep both versions usable in preview ("两版都保留", "keep both versions clickable"), do not write the field; no convergence happens and both navigation chains remain intact.

## `data-dom-id` Maintenance Rules

The `data-dom-id` attributes already present on HTML elements are business-critical fields for the runtime parser:

- [FORBIDDEN] **Must not delete**: Even if the Agent believes there are too many wires or they can be "optimized", it is **absolutely forbidden** to remove any existing `data-dom-id` and corresponding interaction, unless the **user explicitly requests** removal
- [FORBIDDEN] **Must not edit**: Must not modify existing `data-dom-id` values or move them to other elements
- [Yes] **May add**: New elements may add new `data-dom-id` when they are part of the visible wiring map or hidden interaction plan (must comply with naming convention)

### Version Convergence Exception

When executing Version Convergence (see "Version Convergence" section above), the Main Agent is **allowed and required** to:

- Modify existing interaction entries' `targetPageId` so they point to the newest superseding page
- Clear the superseded page node's `interactions` to `[]`

This exception applies **only to the `.design` interactions registry**. The `data-dom-id` attributes in HTML files remain fully covered by the "must not delete / must not edit" rules above — convergence never touches HTML.

### Redesign Scenario Exception

When restructuring HTML structure on a **Fork copy** via the `redesign-project-ui.md` workflow, the above "must not delete/edit" rules may be relaxed:

- If page structure restructuring causes the HTML element carrying `data-dom-id` to be removed or restructured, **it is allowed** to delete or migrate `data-dom-id` in the copy
- But the copy's `.design` file `interactions` must be simultaneously updated — remove invalidated wiring entries, or keep interactions unchanged after migrating `data-dom-id` to the new element
- This exception **only applies to Fork copies**; the original project's `data-dom-id` remains under the "absolutely forbidden to delete" constraint
