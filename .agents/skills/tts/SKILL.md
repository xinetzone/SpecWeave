## When to Use

- User wants to convert text to spoken audio
- User asks for "read aloud", "TTS", "text to speech", "voice narration"
- User says "朗读", "配音", "语音合成"
- User wants multi-speaker scripted audio or dialogue

## When NOT to Use

- User wants a podcast-style discussion with topic exploration (use `/podcast`)
- User wants an explainer video with visuals (use `/explainer`)
- User wants to generate an image (use `/image-gen`)

## Purpose

Convert text into natural-sounding speech audio. Two paths:

1. **Quick mode** (`/v1/tts`): Single voice, low-latency, sync MP3 stream. For casual chat, reading snippets, instant audio.
2. **Script mode** (`/v1/speech`): Multi-speaker, per-segment voice assignment. For dialogue, audiobooks, scripted content.

## Hard Constraints

- No shell scripts. Construct curl commands from the API reference files listed in Resources
- Always read `shared/authentication.md` for API key and headers
- Follow `shared/common-patterns.md` for errors and interaction patterns
- Never hardcode speaker IDs in API calls — use built-in defaults from `shared/speaker-selection.md` as fallback only; fetch from the speakers API when the user wants to change voice
- Always read config following `shared/config-pattern.md` before any interaction
- Always follow `shared/speaker-selection.md` for speaker selection (text table + free-text input)
- Never save files to `~/Downloads/` or `/tmp/` as primary output — save artifacts to the current working directory with friendly topic-based names (see `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming)

<HARD-GATE>
Use the AskUserQuestion tool for every multiple-choice step — do NOT print options as plain text. Ask one question at a time. Wait for the user's answer before proceeding to the next step. After all parameters are collected, summarize the choices and ask the user to confirm. Do NOT call any generation API until the user has explicitly confirmed.

</HARD-GATE>

## Mode Detection

Determine the mode from the user's input **automatically** before asking any questions:

| Signal | Mode |
|--------|------|
| "多角色", "脚本", "对话", "script", "dialogue", "multi-speaker" | Script |
| Multiple characters mentioned by name or role | Script |
| Input contains structured segments (A: ..., B: ...) | Script |
| Single paragraph of text, no character markers | Quick |
| "读一下", "read this", "TTS", "朗读" with plain text | Quick |
| Ambiguous | Quick (default) |

## Interaction Flow

### Step -1: API Key Check

Follow `shared/config-pattern.md` § API Key Check. If the key is missing, stop immediately.

### Step 0: Config Setup

Follow `shared/config-pattern.md` Step 0 (Zero-Question Boot).

**If file doesn't exist** — silently create with defaults and proceed:
```bash
mkdir -p ".listenhub/tts"
echo '{"outputMode":"inline","language":null,"defaultSpeakers":{}}' > ".listenhub/tts/config.json"
CONFIG_PATH=".listenhub/tts/config.json"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```
**Do NOT ask any setup questions.** Proceed directly to the Interaction Flow.

**If file exists** — read config silently and proceed:
```bash
CONFIG_PATH=".listenhub/tts/config.json"
[ ! -f "$CONFIG_PATH" ] && CONFIG_PATH="$HOME/.listenhub/tts/config.json"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```

### Setup Flow (user-initiated reconfigure only)

Only run when the user explicitly asks to reconfigure. Display current settings:
```
当前配置 (tts)：
  输出方式：{inline / download / both}
  语言偏好：{zh / en / 未设置}
  默认主播：{speakerName / 使用内置默认}
```

Then ask:

1. **outputMode**: Follow `shared/output-mode.md` § Setup Flow Question.

2. **Language** (optional): "默认语言？"
   - "中文 (zh)"
   - "English (en)"
   - "每次手动选择" → keep `null`

After collecting answers, save immediately:
```bash
NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$CONFIG" | jq --arg m "$OUTPUT_MODE" '. + {"outputMode": $m}')
# Save language if user chose one (not "每次手动选择")
if [ "$LANGUAGE" != "null" ]; then
  NEW_CONFIG=$(echo "$NEW_CONFIG" | jq --arg lang "$LANGUAGE" '. + {"language": $lang}')
fi
echo "$NEW_CONFIG" > "$CONFIG_PATH"
CONFIG=$(cat "$CONFIG_PATH")
```

### Quick Mode — `POST /v1/tts`

**Step 1: Extract text**

Get the text to convert. If the user hasn't provided it, ask:

> "What text would you like me to read aloud?"

**Step 2: Determine voice**

- If `config.defaultSpeakers.{language}[0]` is set → use it silently (skip to Step 4)
- If not set → use the **built-in default** from `shared/speaker-selection.md` for the detected language (skip to Step 4)
- Only show speaker selection if the user explicitly asks to change voice

**Step 3: Save preference**

After the user explicitly selects a new voice (not when using defaults):

```
Question: "Save {voice name} as your default voice for {language}?"
Options:
  - "Yes" — update .listenhub/tts/config.json
  - "No" — use for this session only
```

**Step 4: Confirm**

```
Ready to generate:

  Text: "{first 80 chars}..."
  Voice: {voice name}

Proceed?
```

**Step 5: Generate**

```bash
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/tts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Source: skills" \
  -d '{"input": "...", "voice": "..."}' \
  --output /tmp/tts-output.mp3
```

**Step 6: Present result**

Read `OUTPUT_MODE` from config. Follow `shared/output-mode.md` for behavior.

Use a timestamped jobId: `$(date +%s)`

**`inline` or `both`** (TTS quick returns a sync audio stream — no `audioUrl`):
```bash
JOB_ID=$(date +%s)
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/tts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Source: skills" \
  -d '{"input": "...", "voice": "..."}' \
  --output /tmp/tts-${JOB_ID}.mp3
```
Then use the Read tool on `/tmp/tts-{jobId}.mp3`.

Present:
```
Audio generated!
```

**`download` or `both`**: Generate a topic slug from the text content following `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming.
```bash
SLUG="{topic-slug}"  # e.g. "server-maintenance-notice"
NAME="${SLUG}.mp3"
# Dedup: if file exists, append -2, -3, etc.
BASE="${NAME%.*}"; EXT="${NAME##*.}"; i=2
while [ -e "$NAME" ]; do NAME="${BASE}-${i}.${EXT}"; i=$((i+1)); done
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/tts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Source: skills" \
  -d '{"input": "...", "voice": "..."}' \
  --output "$NAME"
```
Present:
```
Audio generated!

### Script Mode — `POST /v1/speech`

**Step 1: Get scripts**

Determine whether the user already has a scripts array:

- **Already provided** (JSON or clear segments): parse and display for confirmation
- **Not yet provided**: help the user structure segments. Ask:

  > "Please provide the script with speaker assignments. Format: each line as `SpeakerName: text content`. I'll convert it."

  Once the user provides the script, parse it into the `scripts` JSON format.

**Step 2: Assign voices per character**

For each unique character in the script:

- If `config.defaultSpeakers.{language}` has saved voices → auto-assign silently (one per character in order)
- If not set → use **built-in defaults** from `shared/speaker-selection.md` (Primary for first character, Secondary for second)
- Only show speaker selection if the user explicitly asks to change voices

**Step 3: Save preferences**

After all voices are assigned (if any were new):

```
Question: "Save these voice assignments for future sessions?"
Options:
  - "Yes" — update defaultSpeakers in .listenhub/tts/config.json
  - "No" — use for this session only
```

**Step 4: Confirm**

```
Ready to generate:

  Characters:
    {name}: {voice}
    {name}: {voice}
  Segments: {count}
  Title: (auto-generated)

Proceed?
```

**Step 5: Generate**

Write the request body to a temp file, then submit:

```bash
# Write request to temp file
cat > /tmp/lh-speech-request.json << 'ENDJSON'
{
  "scripts": [
    {"content": "...", "speakerId": "..."},
    {"content": "...", "speakerId": "..."}
  ]
}
ENDJSON

# Submit
curl -sS -X POST "https://api.marswave.ai/openapi/v1/speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $LISTENHUB_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Source: skills" \
  -d @/tmp/lh-speech-request.json

rm /tmp/lh-speech-request.json
```

**Step 6: Present result**

Read `OUTPUT_MODE` from config. Follow `shared/output-mode.md` for behavior.

**`inline` or `both`**: Display the `audioUrl` and `subtitlesUrl` as clickable links.

Present:
```
Audio generated!

在线收听：{audioUrl}
字幕：{subtitlesUrl}
时长：{audioDuration / 1000}s
消耗积分：{credits}
```

**`download` or `both`**: Also download the file. Generate a topic slug following `shared/config-pattern.md` § Artifact Naming.
```bash
SLUG="{topic-slug}"  # e.g. "welcome-dialogue"
NAME="${SLUG}.mp3"
# Dedup: if file exists, append -2, -3, etc.
BASE="${NAME%.*}"; EXT="${NAME##*.}"; i=2
while [ -e "$NAME" ]; do NAME="${BASE}-${i}.${EXT}"; i=$((i+1)); done
curl -sS -o "$NAME" "{audioUrl}"
```
Present:
```
已保存到当前目录：
  {NAME}
```

## Updating Config

When saving preferences, merge into `.listenhub/tts/config.json` — do not overwrite unchanged keys.

- Quick voice: set `defaultSpeakers.{language}[0]` to the selected `speakerId`
- Script voices: set `defaultSpeakers.{language}` to the full array assigned this session
- Language: set `language` if the user explicitly specifies it

## API Reference

- TTS & Speech endpoints: `shared/api-tts.md`
- Speaker list: `shared/api-speakers.md`
- Speaker selection guide: `shared/speaker-selection.md`
- Error handling: `shared/common-patterns.md` § Error Handling
- Long text input: `shared/common-patterns.md` § Long Text Input

## Composability

- **Invokes**: speakers API (for speaker selection)
- **Invoked by**: explainer (for voiceover)

## Examples

**Quick mode:**

> "TTS this: The server will be down for maintenance at midnight."

1. Detect: Quick mode (plain text, "TTS this")
2. Read config: `quickVoice` is `null`
3. Fetch speakers, user picks "Yuanye"
4. Ask to save → yes → update config
5. `POST /v1/tts` with `input` + `voice`
6. Present: `/tmp/tts-output.mp3`

**Script mode:**

> "帮我做一段双人对话配音，A说：欢迎大家，B说：谢谢邀请"

1. Detect: Script mode ("双人对话")
2. Parse segments: A → "欢迎大家", B → "谢谢邀请"
3. Read config: `scriptVoices` empty
4. Fetch `zh` speakers, assign A and B voices
5. Ask to save → yes → update config
6. `POST /v1/speech` with scripts array
7. Present: `audioUrl`, `subtitlesUrl`, duration
